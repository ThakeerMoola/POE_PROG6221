INTODUCTION
-----------
First and foremost, I have programmed a Windows Presentation Application(GUI), which gives users a user-friendly look, it allows users to enter their specified amount of ingredients, units of measurement, quantities, and the number of steps involved. This application saves users data in arrays, so when displayed, it will output what the user has entered. Screenshots of this will be included below.

------------------------------
SOFTWARE OVERVIEW AND CHANGERS
------------------------------
This software is straight-forward and follows good coding standards as well as excellent indentation style, making it visible and neat for the user who's working on the code. The code itself has comments on it that are detailed, which means the next coder or programmer can understand what was done on the code and does not need further assistance as to what is going on in this code. Each method, loop, statement, if, and else has comments on it.

This is a (WPA) which was a build up from the previus versions which was first command line, in this final project, loads of changes were made, and code impementation in to the (WPA) as well. The add-ons on this application were the filtering option, which means users can now filter each recipe by the ingredient name, amount of calories, or the drop-down food group combo box. This makes it easier for the user using this application, as users can search a recipe by the amount of calories; for instance, if a user enters 200 calories, all the recipes that were added to the system will be displayed as having 200 calories, meaning a user can scroll through all those lovely recipes and choose the correct one. Some of the code that was implemented in this final project had to go through intense changes, which meant that some code was never used and some code was actually tweaked in order for it to work correctly.

--------------------------------
INSTRICTUONS ON HOW TO COMPILE
--------------------------------
First of all, users can compile the software either using an online compiler, or an IDE such as vs code Visual studio, netbeans and many more. once the IDE is opened, user can extract the zip folder and open it in their prefered IDE, and select run POE-PART3, as seen below.

This will than run the code and the first window will pop up, which will welcome the user to the application, the user can than make a selection by clicking the button option available to user.

Users can than fill in the following by reading the labels and than filling in the required textboxes, once all that is done, user can click add Ingredients, by doing this it will say data in the Array List <t>, user can then have the option to add more ingredients as well, once user is done, go ahead and click the display current recipe, or click home button to view and display other recipes. for example; when the display all recipes is clicked, system will prompt user to enter a number for the recipe to be viewed.
